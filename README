== USAGE ==

Tests in test_* tests/ and examples in examples/ are the only documentation.

For interactive environment use:
$ ./rlisp.rb
rlisp> (+ 2 2)
4
rlisp> ^D
$

For running things use:
$ ./rlisp.rb tests/fib.rl
(1 2 3 5 8)
$

You can write RLisp one-liners with -e:
$ ./rlisp.rb -e '(print (+ 2 40))'
42
$

or with -i -e to print all evaluated expressions:
$ ./rlisp.rb -ie '(+ 2 40)'
42
$

Enjoy :-)
